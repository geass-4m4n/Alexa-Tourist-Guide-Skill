# Alexa-Tourist-Guide-Skill
This skill will guide tourist at historical sites in India.

Some features are:- 

1. Alexa recommends a nearby tourist attraction

2. provides direction to a place

3. recommends nearby restaurants

4. provide reviews for a place or restaurant

5. provides a helpline number of the local authority.

I am using AWS lambda function as backend for Alexa. Lambda function is programmed in python and calls different
google map APIs to provide information to tourist.
